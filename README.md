# Modern React with Vite Net Ninja

In this repository I have pushed all the files that I have created and learned by following Net Ninja's [Modern React Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&si=IRwx8QeFk7R-lvc-) playlist.

Here I have used ReactJS with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
